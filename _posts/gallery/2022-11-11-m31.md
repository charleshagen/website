Andromeda has been a target I have wanted to shoot for a while but I wanted to wait to do it justice. This was a very fun image to process and of course, with the Hydrogen clouds being so faint and with such little integration time, it was a very nice challenge to get the image to the state that it is currently in. I will be posting a tutorial to my website, nightphotons.com, on my process for integrating H-alpha signal into LRGB images.

| Green      | 11×180″   | 33′         |
| Blue       | 11×180″   | 33′         |
| H-alpha    | 34×600″   | 5h 40′      |
