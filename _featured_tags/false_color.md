## Preamble:

False color imagery involves assigning real data to different colors than they would appear to the eye. These colors are not fabricated, they are simply different mappings of signals. This allows for other structures and details to be seen more clearly by increasing color contrast. All images in this false color gallery are SHO, meaning S-II emission is mapped to red, H-alpha is mapped to green, and O-III is mapped to blue.
